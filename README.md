# 🧠 End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This is a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** built with Python. It includes everything from data ingestion to model training and (soon) deployment using cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a robust, modular ML pipeline from scratch  
- Practice real-world MLOps techniques like logging, exception handling, and config management  
- Containerize the application using Docker  
- Deploy on multiple cloud platforms (AWS Beanstalk, EC2 with ECR, Azure Containers)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo  
git clone https://github.com/shishiradk/mlproject.git  
cd mlproject  

# 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  

# 3. Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

---

## 🧪 Run the Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

This triggers the end-to-end ML pipeline including:  
- Data ingestion  
- Data transformation  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation (coming soon)

## 🌐 Deployment Plans

Deployment steps (coming soon):  
- [ ] Containerize with Docker  
- [ ] Deploy Flask app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
- [ ] Set up EC2 instance with ECR integration  
- [ ] Experiment with Azure Container Instances
